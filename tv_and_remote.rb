# In this exercise, you will be creating two classes AND the driver code to test them.
# You will create a Tv class and a Remote class. 

# The Tv class will have the attributes: power, volume, and channel. 

# The Remote class will have just one attribute: tv. This will represent which tv it
# actually controls.
# The Remote will have the following instance methods: 
# toggle_power (this will turn off the tv if it's on, or turn it on if it's off)
# increment_volume (this will increase the tv's volume by 1)
# decrement_volume (this will decrease the tv's volume by 1)
# set_channel (this will change the tv's channel to whatever integer is passed to this method)
